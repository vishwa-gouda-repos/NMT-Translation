Why Neural Machine Translation?

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is designed to imitate the neurons of the human brain. Neurons can make connections, learn new information and can assess input as a whole rather than part by part.

Neural Machine Translation uses a deep learning principles to train the engine themselves using a trial and error process to learn the nature of a sentence.

Neural machine translation uses sequence to sequence architecture and artificial neural network architecture known as a recurrent neural network to model the language sequences. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) encoderâ€“decoder will help to remember, all the information about language sentence and sequence.

Neural Machine Translation basically attempts to utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) to improve the quality of translations. Moving away from the traditional statistical machine translation, the NMT builds a single neural network that can be jointly turned to maximize the translation quality.
